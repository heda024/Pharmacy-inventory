PHARMACY INVENTORY

This is a javascript project allowing you to add medication to a pharmacy inventory. This project is based around object-oriented programming, and allows you to differenciate between a prescription class and a non-prescription class. By filling out the form you can add the new medication to the local storage, and display them with the two different display buttons on the page. Form validation is also used to ensure the needed fields are all filled in. 

I used one of the workshops from class as a guide for this project.
